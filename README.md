WorkoutScheduler
================

Workout scheduling app. Works as a workout calendar/reminder, as well as an in-workout list/trainer.
There are 3 sections - a workout scheduler(calendar), an edit/create workout section and a follow workout section.

In the "workout scheduler" section the user will be able to view existing previous and upcoming workouts, as well as plan new workouts. These workouts contain a time/date and a text description. They are also repeatable, for example weekly.
In the "edit/create workout" section the user will be able to either create a new workout file from scratch or modify an existing file.
In the "follow workout" section the user will be able to select a workout file that they would like to follow. The app will then continuously update and time their sets, giving an alarm when the time limits have been reached.

A workout file will contain an exercise list/order, a between set rest length, a between exercise rest length, exercise interleaving, and rep counts.
